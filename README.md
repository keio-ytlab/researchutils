# Contribution guide
New features and bug fixes are welcome. Send PRs. <br/>
This project is using GitHub flow ([See here for details](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)) for development so do not try to push directly to master branch (It will be rejected anyway).

## Target python versions
Target python versions are 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 (as of August 2018). <br/>
Use [six](https://pythonhosted.org/six/), [future](https://pypi.org/project/future/) or any other libraries to keep compatibility among above python versions.

## Repository structure
### Module structure
Write your features under ./researchutils/ <br/>
Write your tests for the features under ./tests/ <br/>

### When writing utilities for chainer
Keep same directory structure of [original chainer](https://github.com/chainer/chainer) as much as possible under ./researchutils/chainer/. <br/>
For example, if you are writing new chainer.function,  place your new function under <br/>
./researchutils/chainer/functions/xxx/ <br/>
and write import statement in <br/>
./researchutils/chainer/functions/__init\__.py

## Write tests
When adding new feature such as function/class, always and must write test(s) unless it will be rejected.

### Where should I write my feature's tests?
When writing tests, for example for *feature_module*.py, please create test module file of name test_*feature_module_name*.py and place exactly at the same layer of your feature module. <br/>
